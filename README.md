# AWS-IAM
I used AWS IAM to create users, set up an account alias, and define permissions through IAM policies to manage access to EC2 instances.

# AWS IAM Overview

## What is AWS IAM?

AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) manages user permissions and access to AWS resources. It is crucial for securing resources by controlling who can access what, ensuring only authorized users have the necessary permissions.

## How I'm Using AWS IAM in This Project

In this project, AWS IAM was utilized to:

- Create users
- Set up an account alias
- Define permissions through IAM policies

These steps help manage access to EC2 instances and ensure proper authorization.

## One Thing I Didn't Expect...

I was surprised by how straightforward it was to set up AWS IAM. The AWS IAM interface and JSON policy editor simplified creating and managing permissions, streamlining the process and reducing complexity.

# Tags

Tags are key-value pairs assigned to AWS resources. They are useful for organizing, managing, and searching resources, as well as for tracking costs and applying policies based on specific criteria.

The tag I’ve used on my EC2 instances is called `Env`. The values assigned are `development` and `production`.
